## Introduction to Project-Based Workflows with GitHub

Created by [Emma Hudgins](https://ejhudgins.com/) and [Courtney Robichaud](https://crobichaud.weebly.com/)

### About

This workshop teaches users how to get started using project-based workflows with R and GitHub. No experience necessary

We have run this for users at the University of Waterloo and Carleton University, and would be happy to bring it to your department - just get in touch!
